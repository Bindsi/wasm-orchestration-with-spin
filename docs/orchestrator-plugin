# Orchestrator Plugin Design

This article elaborates on how a custom plugin model in Spin is used to develop an orchestrator which can enable Spin component-component communication within the same app, without making a network hop. The focus area of this design is to enable typed communication between the components with WIT as a foundation for contracts and a decoupled service composition design.

[TODO: Expand on design and implementation details]
